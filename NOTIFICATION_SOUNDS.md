# Notification Sound System

## Overview
The HR CRM application now includes a comprehensive notification sound system that plays different audio tones for different types of notifications.

## Features

### üîä Sound Types
- **Leave Request**: Higher frequency (800Hz) with moderate pattern
- **Leave Approved**: Mid frequency (600Hz) with triple beep pattern  
- **Leave Rejected**: Lower frequency (400Hz) with single beep
- **Attendance Reminder**: Mid-low frequency (500Hz) with double beep
- **System Announcement**: Mid-high frequency (700Hz) with quintuple beep pattern
- **Task Assigned**: Mid frequency (650Hz) with triple beep pattern
- **Birthday**: High frequency (800Hz) with celebration pattern
- **Policy Update**: Low-mid frequency (550Hz) with double beep

### üéöÔ∏è Volume Control
Sound volume is automatically adjusted based on notification priority:
- **Low Priority**: 30% volume
- **Medium Priority**: 50% volume  
- **High Priority**: 70% volume
- **Urgent Priority**: 90% volume

### ‚öôÔ∏è User Controls
- **Sound Toggle**: Users can enable/disable notification sounds via the bell icon in the header
- **Sound Preference**: Settings are saved per user and persist across sessions
- **Test Functions**: Admins can test sounds and create test notifications

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Web Audio API
- Primary sound generation using Web Audio API with oscillator nodes
- Dynamic frequency and pattern generation for different notification types
- Gain control for volume management

#### Fallback System
- HTML5 Audio fallback for browsers without Web Audio API support
- Base64 encoded audio data for simple beep sounds

#### Sound Patterns
Each notification type has a unique pattern:
```javascript
pattern: [1, 0.5, 1] // Full volume, half volume, full volume
```

### üì± Integration Points

#### Automatic Sound Triggers
Sounds automatically play when:
- New leave requests are submitted (notifies managers)
- Leave requests are approved/rejected (notifies employees)
- System announcements are created
- Attendance reminders are sent

#### Manual Testing (Admin Only)
- **Test Sound**: Plays default notification sound
